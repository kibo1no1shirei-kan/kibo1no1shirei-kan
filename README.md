:tea:  Hi there, Iâ€™m Kibo (aka Kibo1no1shirei-kan)!
I first started coding during the pandemic - i was introduced to coding because i wanted to make a game, however i ended up realising that games do need assets after a while of messing around going from Renpy to then discord bots to eventually C. 
I eventually discoverd hackclub thought github education, and now i am gonna try to make the game of my Dreams stay tuned!

ðŸŽ“ Dreams & Education

Iâ€™m aiming for Japan through the MEXT scholarship â€” not just to study, but to build a new life there. My dream universities are:

University of Tokyo (Todai)

Kyushu University

University of Aizu (perfect for CS/game dev!)

University of Tsukuba
Why Japan? I am a weeb since i was 13, and i saw its fantasy verstion however right now its Hotubs and the perception of riding trains and eating ramen after working.


ðŸŽ¨ Creative Goals

Besides coding, Iâ€™m diving into art and design. A few personal goals Iâ€™m chasing:

Learn anime illustration

Create my own VTuber model using Cubism Live2D.

I want to also make my own volcaloid music and eventually 

âš¡ What Iâ€™m Into Right Now

Hack Club projects + hackathons (love the energy there)

ðŸŽ¯ Long-term Vision
